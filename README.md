# CORES Programming Language

**CORES** is a lightweight experimental programming language inspired by **CUDA** concepts but designed to run directly on CPU threads.  
It is built for experimenting with **parallel execution**, **thread variables**, and **low-level concurrency** using a simple, Python-like syntax.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Thread-oriented execution model** ‚Äì every `times:` block spawns threads automatically.  
- **Global variables** with live updates across threads (`pub_var`, `PUB_VAR`).  
- **Minimal syntax** with `do`, `times`, `end`, and `wait` blocks.  
- **Built-in thread metadata** for debugging and introspection:  
  - `THREAD-NAME`  
  - `THREAD-NUMBER`  
  - `THREAD-NATIVE-ID`  
  - `THREAD-IS-ALIVE`  
  - `THREAD-DAEMON`  
  - `THREAD-IDENT`  
  - `PUB_VAR`  

---

## üîß Syntax

```
max
py
pub_var=0

do: {
    pub_var = 1
    print("Hello!")
}

times: (9) {
    print("\n")
    pub_var = PUB_VAR + 1
    print("PUB-VAR: ", PUB_VAR)
    print("Info About me:")
    Name = "THREAD-NAME"
    Number = "THREAD-NUMBER"
    NativeNumber = "THREAD-NATIVE-ID"
    AmIAlive = "THREAD-IS-ALIVE"
    deamon = "THREAD-DAEMON"
    MyID = "THREAD-IDENT"
    PublicVar = "PUB_VAR"

    print(Name, Number, NativeNumber, AmIAlive, deamon, MyID, PublicVar)
    print("\n")
}

end: {
    print("Bye!")
}

wait
```

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Output

When the above code runs, the threads will execute concurrently and output will look like:

```
Hello!


PUB-VAR:  1
Info About me:
Thread-3 (thread_main) 3 32860 True True 32860 1


PUB-VAR:  1
Info About me:
Thread-6 (thread_main) 6 19612 True True 19612 1


PUB-VAR:  1
Info About me:
Thread-1 (thread_main) 1 20720 True True 20720 1


PUB-VAR:  1
Info About me:
Thread-4 (thread_main) 4 15716 True True 15716 1


PUB-VAR:  1
Info About me:
Thread-2 (thread_main) 2 1324 True True 1324 1


PUB-VAR:  1
Info About me:
Thread-5 (thread_main) 5 8092 True True 8092 1


PUB-VAR:  1
Info About me:
Thread-7 (thread_main) 7 26424 True True 26424 1


PUB-VAR:  1
Info About me:
Thread-8 (thread_main) 8 15868 True True 15868 1


PUB-VAR:  1
Info About me:
Thread-9 (thread_main) 9 27796 True True 27796 1


Bye!
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Because threads run concurrently, the order of output is not guaranteed. Each run may produce slightly different interleaving of lines.
üß© Keywords

    do: ‚Üí Defines an initialization block (runs once before threading).

    times: (N) ‚Üí Spawns N threads that run the block concurrently.

    end: ‚Üí Defines a cleanup block (runs once after threading).

    wait ‚Üí Ensures the main process waits for all threads to finish.

üöÄ Future Goals

    Add support for async do blocks.

    Shared memory handling beyond PUB_VAR.

    File I/O and networking inside thread blocks.

    GPU-like parallel kernel simulation.
